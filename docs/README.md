## :rocket: Getting Started

**Pre-requisite**

- Access to the Under Armour network (on-site or VPN)

Head on over to [https://skipjack.shop.ua.com](https://skipjack.shop.ua.com) and authenticate with
your Active Directory account.

> **Access Issues?**
>
> It's our intent to provide as much access to the information available in Skipjack, as possible,
> but we're still using Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to keep our system and data safe. When a
> user authenticates via Active Directory (AD), we provision roles based on the groups provided in
> the response from AD.
>
> If you're unable to access something that you believe you should, the best
> course of action is to confirm with your manager whether or not you should
> have it or not. Second to that is confirming whether or not your AD profile
> has all of the correct Active Directory groups for your business role.
>
> If you're still blocked, check out the _[Need Help?](#need-help)_ section below and let us know.

## :world_map: Roadmap
