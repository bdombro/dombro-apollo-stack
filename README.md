# Dombro's Apollo Stack

I've been working with Apollo stacks for years, so it seemed time I make a reference stack to demonstrate my opinions.

Status: Working, but unstable.

Batteries included:
1. Type-strict Apollo GraphQL Server
2. Type-strict React Client
3. Authentication
4. Hot-reloading Developer Experience
5. Advanced env/config management (almost done)
6. Postgres (coming soon)
7. Production Builds (coming soon)

## Getting started

```shell script
npm i
npm start
```
